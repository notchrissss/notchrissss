# right so hey, i'm chris 🙋‍♀️
i'm from the east midlands/east anglia, but i've settled here in adelaide, south australia.
i'm not the greatest dev in the world, some wouldn't even consider me one. i'm more of a system administrator who knows how to script shit.
really only here for the student perks 🤚
